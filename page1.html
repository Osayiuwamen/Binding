  <p class="description">"Please tell me this is a joke."</p>
  <section class="word">
    <div class="word1">
      <p>I know from personal experience how much consumers dislike change, and I have a clue why. Several years ago,
        Pentagram
        received an assignment to redesign the logo for the Big Ten college athletic conference. This wasn't change for
        change's
        sake.
      </p>
      <p>The existing logo incorporated a number eleven, FedEx arrow-style, to acknowledge the fact that the number of
        teams in
        the conference did not correspond to the conference's name. Now the conference was expanding to twelve teams,
        requiring
        a new logo, and ideally one that didn't incorporate its own obsolescence.</p>
      <p>If there's one group that gets even more agitated about logos than college alumni, it's sports fans. That made
        this
        particular job, which combined both, a perfect storm.</p>
      <p>Moments after our new logo (which incorporated the number 10 into the word "big") was unveiled, the reaction
        started
        pouring in, almost all negative: "Epic fail," "looks like it took 25 seconds to make," "the gayest thing I've
        ever
        seen," and, of course, the inevitable conclusion that it looked like "a four-year-old from Chicago designed it
        in
        her
        sleep."</p>
      <p>What is it about four year olds, anyway?Then there were the emails that were sent to us directly. "You should
        be
        completely embarrassed." "Lame and boring." "So bad." "Please tell me this is a joke." "My 13 year old could
        have
        done
        better with a blank piece of paper and a pencil." (This last represents a kind of progress, at least.)</p>

    </div>
    <div class="word1">
      <p>Reasoning that people who took the time to look up our email address and send a note — no matter how filled
        with
        swear
        words — deserved a response, we replied with regret for their disappoinment in our work and our hope that the
        logo
        would
        grow on them. And we always ended with an acknowledgement of the passion of our correspondents; as I told Fast
        Company,
        "It's that exact same passion that fills the seats at every game."
      </p>
      <p>Almost every person we answered to wrote back. Some softened their criticism, some did not, but all expressed
        surprise
        that anyone wrote back at all. Clearly, part of the anger this change aroused was based on the idea that it was
        being
        imposed on them by remote, detached "experts" with no concern for the feelings of loyal fans, fans who have
        their
        own
        unique histories with their brands, histories that had abruptly been rendered null and void.And this sense of
        alienation, more than anything else, is the fuel for the rising tide of logo crowdsmashing.
      </p>
      <p>Here New York's Paul Ford got it exactly right: "People don’t like their stories messed with. You expect a
        certain
        continuity, and when the opposite happens...you react out of proportion to external measures of the offense but
        very
        much in proportion to the internal anxiety and anger you might feel." In this case, our (wonderful) client held
        firm,
        the anger subsided, and two years later people do seem to be getting used to the logo.</p>
