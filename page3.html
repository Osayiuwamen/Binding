  <p class="description">"Does This Logo Make Me Look<br>
    Pathological and Self-Loathing?"</p>
  <section class="word">
    <div class="word1">
      <p>We live at a moment that rewards snap judgments, ideally delivered in short Twitter-ready bursts. As a
        fifty-something
        graphic designer, for decades I practiced my career in relative obscurity. For most of my life, people have
        reacted with
        mild bafflement as I tried to explain what I do for a living. No more. After thirty-five years, suddenly
        everybody
        is
        interested in what I do. I just tell them that I design logos.
      </p>
      <p>Early in 2016, a new logo starting appearing here and there. It was for New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art.
        Many new
        logos get criticized for being too simple and boring. The Met's logo is not that. It reduces the name to two red
        three-letter words—THE MET—and composes those six letters in a complex arrangement, connecting each to the next,
        merging
        the verticals in the HE and ME pairs, all in a font with exaggerated serifs that border on flamboyant. It is a
        nervy,
        bold design that begs for a strong reaction, and that's what it got.</p>
      <p>Justin Davidson from New York fired the first salvo, calling it a "graphic misfire" that looked like "a red
        double-decker bus that has stopped short, shoving the passengers into each other's backs." Soon, others joined
        the
        chorus, including Times critic Michael Kimmelman ("pathological and self-loathing"), Vanity Fair's Paul
        Goldberger
        ("the
        vibe of insecurity"), and Hyperallergic's Jennifer Bostic ("a really unfortunate mistake.")</p>
      <>The visceral reaction provoked by this peculiar combination of letterforms was further augmented by an onslaught
        of
        affection for the Met's previous logo. This was a constructed letter M in a circle based on drawings by
        Franciscan
        friar
        Luca Pacioli first published in his book "De divina proportione." People tend to prefer old logos to new ones.
        The
        Met
        M-in-circle had been in use since 1971; if that isn't old enough for you, Pacioli published his book in 1503.
        Abandoning
        500 years of tradition was too much for otherwise progressive designer Karim Rashid, who told the New York
        Times,
        "We're
        talking here about a museum that's all about history. So the best thing they could do is hang on to keeping
        their
        mark—or their logo—historic." Of course what Rashid is describing is not a museum, but a cemetery.
        Okay: I admit it. I liked the new Met logo the first time I saw it, and the more I see it, the more I like it.
        </p>
    </div>
    <div class="word1">
      <p>There are lots and lots of reasons that this is, if not a great logo, then certainly a better logo than the one
        it's
        replacing. The old symbol, that beloved (albeit to my eyes kind of generic and clip-artsy) Pacioli M, needed to
        be
        captioned with the full name of the institution: five words, ten syllables, twenty-six letters, all in poor old
        Trajan.
      </p>
      <p>This was cumbersome in every sense, particularly as the institution prepares to open in the former Whitney
        Museum
        building on Madison Avenue (to be renamed The Met Breuer after its architect). That new site, along with the
        less-visited but utterly lovely Cloisters, makes the Met a citywide complex that demands not a monolithic
        identity, but
        a way to connect up all the pieces. The new logo, a self-reading wordmark that acknowledges the institution's
        two-syllable colloquial name, will serve effectively as the hinge for the whole system.
      </p>
      <p>But all of these thoughts came later. The first thing I thought when I saw the new identity was quite simple:
        If
        this
        thing was forty-five years old, it would be the most beloved logo in New York.
