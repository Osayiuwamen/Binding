  <p class="description">Steven Heller's searing 1993<br>assessment of the<br>role of design critics
  </p>
  <section class="word">
    <div class="word1">
      <p>This article by Steven Heller originally ran in AIGA’s The Journal in 1993 (vol. 11, no. 4). It’s part of a
        series in
        which we invite a new generation of design critics to page through our archives and respond to an article of
        their
        choice. Check back in a week for the next installment in this conversation between past and present.
      </p>
      <p>“In a culture whose already classical dilemma is the hypertrophy of the intellect at the expense of energy and
        sensual
        capability, interpretation is the revenge of the intellect upon art.” —Susan Sontag, Against Interpretation".
      </p>
      <p>Whoever said “Criticism is easy, art is difficult,” echoed the lament of many artists bruised by judgmental
        reviewers.
        Yet true criticism—in-depth analysis and incisive interpretation—is endemic to any public endeavor where the
        quality of
        ideas and execution requires scrutiny.</p>
      <p>“Criticism is the windows and chandeliers of art,” wrote the critic George Jean Nathan. “It illuminates the
        enveloping
        darkness in which art might otherwise rest only vaguely discernible and perhaps altogether unseen.” Graphic
        design
        is
        indeed vaguely discernible—seen but not understood, consumed but not appreciated as part of a larger social,
        commercial,
        and cultural context. At least that’s the complaint practitioners who view themselves and their work as more
        culturally
        significant than their world (or their clients) gives them credit for. They clamor for a body of criticism that
        will
        help legitimize the graphic design profession as criticism did for architecture and industrial design. In turn,
        some
        editors and writers have rejected the conventional celebratory “journalism” in the trade press for the rigors of
        critical analysis, which looks through cultural and social lenses in addition to the aesthetic and business
        ones.
      </p>
      <p>Yet the critical response to criticism has been mixed. Some veteran designers, who for years have been
        sheltered
        from
        criticism, have referred to it as name-calling. Younger designers insist that they want a cold eye, but in fact
        prefer a
        warm hand. Celebrating success and ignoring failure has been the prevailing editorial policy for years.
        Substituting a
        rigorous critical analysis, no matter how positive, does not compensate for the loss of flattering profiles that
        can be
        used as self-promotion. This ambivalence has essentially limited the potential forums for critical discourse.
        Most
        design magazines continue to showcase good work as primary content, and since relatively few publication
        channels
        are
        available, intelligent criticism is developing slowly. Although the quality of design writing has generally
        improved as
        journalism has replaced cronyism, the current level of criticism fluctuates between the astute and the
        sophomoric.
        Seasoned and neophyte writers alike are grappling with a problem of how to develop a unique critical vocabulary
        or
        adapt
        such existing methodologies as semiotics and French linguistic theory.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="word1">
      <p>This leads one to the curious conclusion that there is both too much and too little graphic design criticism
        today: too
        much undisciplined rhetoric and too little rigorous analysis.
      </p>
      <p>Yet for a profession that until recently had a dearth of critical discourse, save for the tacit disapproval
        that
        comes
        with rejection from annual competitions, it could also be said that any semblance of graphic design criticism is
        better
        than none. We now have the basis for a more viable discipline; editors and writers on graphic design are
        beginning
        to
        realize that analysis, argument, and debate are necessary cornerstones in building a profession out of this
        service-oriented field. But the true nature of graphic design criticism has yet to be adequately defined. Is it
        academic
        or journalistic? Who’s qualified to practice? What are the rules of the game? And what and who are fair game for
        critical investigation?

      </p>
      <p>Without these basic, as yet unestablished, parameters, graphic design criticism is merely an amateur sport.
